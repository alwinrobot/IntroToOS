#Part 6
-Established our project as a collection of extensions for the atom text editor instead of just one extension. 
-The extension that's I'm working on is a multi-highlight tool that'll let you selected multiple of the same word using double click
-The current implementation only allows for one word to be highlight selected, the proposed plan is to make multiple words be selected with different coloring to indicate. 
-created a branch of the repo which is updated to currently select a single highlight.
