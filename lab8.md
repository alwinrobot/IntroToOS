#Part 6
- Established our project as a collection of extensions for the atom text editor instead of just one extension. 
- The extension that I'm working on is a multi-highlight tool that'll let you selected multiple of the same word using double click. 
- The current implementation only allows for one word to be highlight selected, the proposed plan is to make multiple words be selected with different coloring to indicate. 
- Created a branch of the repo which is updated to currently select a single highlight.
