- A license allows software to be freely used, modified, and shared. Having a license means more control of how copyright law is applied to your project

#3

- Without a license, software is subjected to default copyright laws. The owner of the software retains all rights and nobody else can reproduce or modify your code. This significantly reduces the ability of a community to contribute and build on your work. 
- Can get sued if you use technology that doesn't belong to you in your work

#4

- Seeing as I'm in an open source class, I'd probably agree with the claim that the "right thing to do" generally does lose to "worse is better". The idea of releasing a weaker version earlier to work out the bugs and gain interest in development generally allows for a stronger end product than releasing a final project that is never touched again. Gopher generally took it on itself to try and make the right decision where a decision made on behalf of users would have been better for the suvival of the system as a whole. 

#5

- Linux uses its GPL v2 license because Linux has such a large number of developers and contributors from multiple decades that getting them to agree to a new license is virtually impossible. 
- GPL v2 allows linux to be free regardless of how much later versions of that are modified

#6

- Can't think of a specific project but I'd imagine wanting any improvements to what I make to be freely available so the GPL license is probably what I'd use.

#7

- For a developer, the best license to use would probably be a MIT license since work you do could remain seperate from any alterations
- For the common good, the best license would probably be a GPL license or a LGPL since they allow for the software to be modified and improved while still remaining free
- For a company the best license would proabably be the MIT license since that frees you from liability
